# v2_Save-foci-ROI-in-batch-%thr_only-foci

Put the macro.txt in in the folder where you have the input files.

Run the macro.

Select in the following order: an input folder with the .tiff of the nuclei, an input folder of the corresponding single nuclei .roi, and an output folder where the .zip will be automatically saved.

Foci are identified by thresholding the intensity signal to the 0.15%. If you want to change the percentage just change the value in the corresponding line inside the code.

The output .zip file DOES NOT include the .roi of the entire nucleus (the input .roi) in the output .zip file.
